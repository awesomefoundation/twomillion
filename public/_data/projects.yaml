    The Big Hammock was the first application to sway the Boston trustees to award a $1000 Awesome Grant. An enormous 33 foot long hammock on a self-supporting steel frame was located in a Boston park offering swinging good times to the public. Six years later, it is woven through Awesome lore, and continues to be regarded as one of the best projects.  Since then, chapter after chapter has been roped in the world over to suspend boring notions of urban life, and distribute Awesome across the globe.

    Distance Music was designed to take advantage of the delay caused by the speed of sound over distance by placing sound sources far away from the audience.  Members of the audience walked around a lake, while a series of air hornes and brass bands played music at different points.  The music an audience member heard was dependent on which sounds reached them first.

    On most days of the year, you pass by your fellow pedestrians without noticing them, but on Nametag Day, you'll have a chance to break the ice with total strangers.  Volunteers stand at certain corners, give out nametags and encourage people to say hi to anyone else with a nametag during the day.  What started as an Awesome Grant in NYC back in 2014 has now spread to other cities in the US and to Brazil.

    #PopScope is short for Pop Up Telescope, and they have instigated a rash of public astronomy viewings across North America. When neighbours kept on asking to see through the founders' telescope, they wondered what would happen if they gave the same opportunity to people across the city.  The intial Ottawa award was followed by Awesome grants in Baltimore and Philadelphia for their own #PopScope chapters.

    What happens when you hide money in pink envelopes all over a city?  The city of Liverpool found out, with a campaign called Awesome Fivers. Designed to encourage social sharing, the envelopes contained a Â£5 bill and a note asking recipients to share the awesome story with 10 people they know.  The project has since been replicated in many other cities.
