    I am building a little vardo (a Romani or gypsy wagon) on a small 5' x 8' trailer. It is sort of like a little camper, with a bed, fold-down table, shelves and a tiny kitchen - but way more romantic. (Google images of 'vardo' to see what I mean!)

    Part of the reason for building the vardo is so I can set up a little mending station and be truly mobile. I have a hand-crank sewing machine for places with no electricity, but will also incorporate electrical outlets and wiring so I can plug the vardo in to power my trusty 1964 Singer sewing machine.

    I plan to visit places around the state, and let folks know in advance that I will take in their mending. Once I'm in a community, I will offer workshops, meet people, listen to their stories, and mend their worn and loved textiles.
